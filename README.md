|---|---|---|---|---|
| :mag_right:  [HIV Differential Gene Expression](https://github.com/Sydney-Simpson/HIV-Differential-Gene-Expression)) | July 2025 | Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Visualization.| R, SQL| Combined, processed, and analyzed two datasets from the GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO) containing microarray data of gene expression for ~40,000 probes from 121 samples taken from persons either negative for HIV or infected with HIV-1, HIV-2, or both forms of HIV. Performed differential gene expression analysis.|

|ðŸ”†[8-Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/Sydney-Simpson/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)| Data analysis, data transformation | This repo serves as my answer to the solutions for the 8 case studies from the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). They show case my abilities in writing SQL queries and problem solving skills.|
| [Visualizing Hospital Acquired Infections in Health Value Based Performance Facilities](https://github.com/Sydney-Simpson/HVBP-Hospital-Acquired-Infections) | Data Wrangling and Manupulation | Created an interactive visualization tool using publicly available data to display a dashboard on hospital acquired infection rates from 2021 - 2023|

| [HCV Status Prediction Using Classification Models](https://github.com/Sydney-Simpson/HCV-Status-Prediction-Using-a-Random-Forest-Classification-Model/tree/main) | In Progress | Machine Learning, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classification, Data Manipulation | Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn), Jupyter Notebook | This project utilizes a various classification models to predict the presence of Hepatitis C in individuals using a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which includes laboratory values and demographic information. The model aims to accurately classify samples as positive or negative for Hepatitis C, leveraging the robustness of random forest and gradient boosting techniques for binary classification problems. |
